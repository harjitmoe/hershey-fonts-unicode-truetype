# TrueType Unicode Hershey fonts

Download a `.ttc` from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/harjitmoe/hershey-fonts-unicode-truetype/releases).

Alternatively, to run the conversion script yourself, you'd need:

- Python (tested on Python 3.11)
- Inkscape (invoked in headless mode)
- FontForge (invoked in headless mode) with Python integration
